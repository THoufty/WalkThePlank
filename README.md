# Walk The Plank

## Description

Our project is a pirate themed hangman game. We chose this design because we thought it would be a good way to test and show off our skills with JS and CSS.

## Usage

Upon load, the page will give you a battery of blanks, a 'start game' button and a clickable information infographic.

Click the 'start game' button to start the timer and guess letters by clicking different letters on your keyboard. 

Click the information infographic to the right to open a modal of instructions on how to play the game.
