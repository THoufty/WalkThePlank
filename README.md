# Walk The Plank

## Description

Our project is a pirate themed hangman game. We chose this design because we thought it would be a good way to test and show off our skills with JS and CSS.

## Usage

Upon load, the page will give you a battery of blanks, a 'start game' button and a clickable information infographic.

Click the 'start game' button to start the timer and guess letters by clicking different letters on your keyboard. 

Click the information infographic to the right to open a modal of instructions on how to play the game.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
